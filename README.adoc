== Types of Typing
* Strong/Weak
* Static/Dynamic

=== Weak Dynamic

=== Strong Dynamic

=== Strong Static

=== Weak Static
* aka Stringly-Typed
* Map<Object, Object>

== Tiny Types
* (code usage and impl)
* Why they're useful
** Compile-time safety
** Good OO
** IDE auto-completion
** Refactoring

== Enumerations

== Nullable?

== Types-in-a-box
=== Promise/Future
* A result that _may_ be available later
* ... or may be an exception

=== Option(al)
* A result that may not be there

=== Either/Maybe
* May be successful
* ... or maybe not

=== Functional processing
* Specific types are useful
* 'Type-in-a-box' types - deferred error handling / synchronisation
