Outline

* This is a discussion about types as they're used in day-to-day development - there will be code, and it'll
only take about 20 minutes to go through the content, so feel free to interrupt and ask questions as I go along.
* I'll do my best to define terms as I go, but if I miss something or if I've explained it badly feel free
to interrupt.
* Most of the examples will be in Java, once again, please ask if the syntax doesn't make sense
* I hope I'll prompt developers in any language to think about whether they could use types more effectively.
* One last thing; although I prefer static typing, this isn't about bashing dynamically-typed languages,
but it may give some insight into why some people are more than happy to spend time making the compiler happy.


What

* First, a definition
* Types represent a way to hold some state in our programs
* To be useful we'll write code that uses instances of these types, or maybe returns them
* In the OO paradigm that's usually methods and state in a class
* Procedural and functional styles might include functions and the types they work with in a common module


Types

* Most languages have a core set of types to work with
* There will be one or more numeric types - perhaps different types for integers or floating-point numbers, and
sometimes many refinements on these basic values.
* Character types, such as strings are a basic commodity
* Almost all languages have the concept of a boolean value; something which is either true or false
* Then there are collection types; lists, sets, arrays, dictionaries, tuples and more


Constraints

* By choosing a type to represent a concept we constrain it in some way.
* Choosing integer over float excludes an infinity of possible values
* although we'd certainly want a counter to represent whole numbers, we probably don't want to allow
negative values - that's an extra bit of knowledge specific to how it's being used that.
* Picking a set, or a list, or an array, expresses and limits choices about the values that will
be stored and how we plan to retrieve them.
* Sets don't allow duplicates, lists aren't good for random access
* SQL defines a choice of character types, and allows limits to be set on the size
* Some environments allow a choice of un-modifiable, or immutable, collections; an important safety feature
when shared with concurrent threads.
* So, an important part of the process of low level design for an application is the choice of constraints.


Typing

* We tend to talk about types in a pretty loose way; languages may be described as having weak or
strong type systems but I couldn't find good definitions for what those terms really mean.
* A clearer distinction is between static type-checking (at compile time) and dynamic type-checking at run time
* There are trade-offs to be made by language designers
** Type checks need extra work at compile time, it takes longer between making a change and being able to run it
** but errors like typo's won't show up until runtime if the checks don't happen during compilation
** Types in code, whether compiled or not, help to explain the logic to another programmer
** but some strongly typed languages clutter source code with duplicated detail; Java is prone to this


Dynamic

* This is an example in Ruby, a language with runtime type-checking
* The `greet` function uses the `+` *method* on the "Hello " string, which
expects another string on the right-hand side.
* Nowhere does the code explicitly state what type `name` has, or what type is returned
* We can call `greet` and pass any object we want, but unless it is a string we'll get
an error when we run it
** `(no implicit conversion of Integer into String)`
* When writing production software some extra test effort is needed to make sure everything
lines up
** It's not unusual for Ruby projects to require 100% coverage of all code with automated tests


Static

* Here's the equivalent Java code, notice that both the `name` parameter and the return value have an explicit type
* It's impossible to build code where `greet` is called with anything *except* a `String`
* So that's it; Java is type-safe, it's impossible to get a runtime error for an invalid type.


Object


* Java has the special `Object` class that every class inherits from
* As it happens, the code above both compiles *and* runs successfully because in Java the '+' the right hand side
has `toString()` called on it - changing the type to `String`


What about


* Here's a contrived example where the Java code compiles, but fails at runtime
* The `greet` method takes two parameters now, one for the name of the person to greet, and one
for the number of times to repeat the greeting.
* There's a lot of ceremony where the `repeat` object is *cast* to type `int`, because that's
the type that the `repeat` method needs
* The first call succeeds, the second causes an exception at runtime
* This is one example of dynamic typing in Java, there are others, but I won't go into them now.
* The question is; would anyone choose to do that?


Type not there

* Here, the code is extended to be able to greet many people a number of times.
* The `people` parameter is defined to be a Map, or dictionary, of names (Strings) to number of greetings (an Integer)
* Notice the `var` keyword - that became valid syntax in Java 10 and is an example of _Type Inference_, where the
type of `greetings` is inferred from the expression on the right hand side.
* And then we call it
* The `Map.of(...)` syntax was introduced in Java 9 as a way of creating and initialising a `Map`
* Now, this is what I think of in my head as an example of _"the art of typing without typing"_
* The code has types defined, but they're only enforced in limited ways
* The method `greet` has a well defined contract, and it looks like there should be a compilation failure
* But, because of the history of the Java language, *Generics* (that's the information in the angle brackets)
aren't enforced when dealing with so-called *raw* collections.
* This sort of mistake is much easier to make, but is easily detected by static analysis tools.


Stringly typed

* This one example of where relying on the types native to your programming language may not be enough.
* The intent of the method is straightforward; it takes a name and a place and returns an appropriate greeting
* it compiles and runs *and there's no exception*
* This is a more subtle failure which may not be detected by automated tests.
* Although this is a simple example I'm sure we all have examples in our code bases where there are
lists of `String` and numeric types passed into methods which use some of them to call other methods, perhaps
in a different order.
* This passing around of data is a common place for subtle bugs to accumulate, and makes reasoning about such code
harder than it needs to be.


Micro Types - better?

* So, what's an alternative?
* This is the same method, but we've moved away from the _"Stringly Typed"_ definition
* There are specific types to express the `Name` and `City` concepts
* It's a compilation failure to put these values the wrong way around when calling `greet`
* The typed-values, once defined, can be used safely in other calls


Why 'micro' ?

* Types don't need to be complex, this class has just enough to express a concept.
* The code here creates an immutable wrapper around the pair of `String` values and
expresses a concept of a person's name.
* If the concept evolves, to add a middle name for example, then it can be added in
one place without breaking existing code.

Micro impl

* To just wrap single values it's easy to define a simple parent class to reduce
boilerplate code, and that can be extended to include `equals` and `hashCode` and
more.
* The definition of the specific types can be very small, and they can be combined
to build complex composites of multiple types.


Why useful

* In OO style, once there is a class that represents *Name* or *Location* it will
naturally attract associated methods - such as the coordinates of a geographical
location.
* Refactoring becomes easier - there's one place to change, how identifiers are stored, for example
* Overloaded methods become both safer and more expressive - if age and height were both plain integers
it wouldn't be possible to define separate methods like the last two
* In a statically typed language they add extra safety to check for easy mistakes during compilation
* An IDE such as IntelliJ will automatically pick the correct values from local scope to pass
into a function call.
* There's a lot more to say about micro types, including the trade-offs that they require, but I
want to just cover a few more ways where types can help.


Enum

* If a type represents a fixed set of values, an enumeration can be an easy choice
* In Java, enums can implement interfaces and have methods - they can have behaviour.
* I like to use enumerations to implement a state-machine, where an enumeration represents
each distinct possible state and captures which state comes next in response to a signal


Nullable

* `null` or `nil` has fallen out of favour, the inventor of the null reference , Tony Hoare, refers
to it as his _"billion-dollar mistake"_
* Kotlin, which prioritises interoperability with Java, has a style which strongly discourages `null`,
but has mechanisms in the language to express and constrain valid values.
* Any type which ends with a question mark is allowed to hold a null reference, but the standard types
disallow null and the compiler will insist that any assignment from a nullable value to a non-nullable type
- the result of a Java API call for example - is checked before it is allowed.
* The nullability of a value is a design choice, and is enforced by the compiler


Types in a box

* There are another category of types that are becoming more common as functional-style
programming gains popularity
* These types can be seen as expressing uncertainty about a value; it may be present or not, it might be
one thing or another, or an error may have been thrown while processing.
* The key thing is that this uncertainty is captured in the type system - a program that receives such a type
*must* resolve the uncertainty in order to continue.


Optional

* The `nextFreeSlot` method returns an `Optional` type which wraps a result, in this case there
may or may not be a free time slot that meets the criteria.
* An alternative way to handle this might be to return `null`, but unless the programmer calling
`nextFreeSlot` is familiar with the implementation this is a `NullPointerException` waiting to happen.
* Or the `nextFreeSlot` might throw an exception itself, but handling exceptions breaks up the program
flow and makes code harder to understand
* With `Optional` a developer is forced to make a choice about how to handle the happy and sad paths


Future

* There are different implementations of `Future`, and your language may call them `Promise` s, but they
all express the idea of a value that may not be available _yet_
* They provide an API to handle errors and timeouts, and usually express a way to use a default value


Either/Maybe

* The `buildTheThing` method returns an instance of the `Either` type
* As with the `Optional` type, there are two possible results, but instead of something or nothing
the type wraps one of two concrete outcomes - *left* or *right*
* A common use is returning errors - perhaps the result of validating some input.  By convention the
successful value is _right_, and the alternative is _left_.
* There are other types like this, such as `Try`, and there are ways to work with them to build expressive
pipelines of functions, but that's another story.


ADT

* This Haskell code expresses the concept that billing
information can be
** A credit card, defined by some properties
** cash on delivery
** an invoice, for a specific customer-ID
* Features in other languages can express similar concepts, although not quite as elegantly - a class hierarchy
for example.

Closing

* While I've talked a lot about static types and OO languages it's worth reinforcing that the concepts are
just as valid in dynamically-checked languages, and for procedural and functional styles.
* *But* if you do use a statically typed language, thinking about types and using some of these techniques can
help to make the code you write safer, and easier to work with and understand.
* That expressiveness is a big part of what I enjoy about developing in statically typed languages; as developers
we spend *so* much more time reading code than writing it, using types that express the intent and behaviour leaves
me more time to think and less need to guess and assume.
* The languages and tools we use both enable and constrain, by embracing the constraints of the type system
we can make it more valuable to us in our day to day work, and to the systems we build.
